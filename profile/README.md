## üêß Overview

**NexisOS** is a free and open-source Linux distribution designed to offer complete transparency, control, and reproducibility. Leveraging a custom **Rust-based system level declarative package manager**, NexisOS introduces a fully declarative configuration system inspired by **NixOS** and **Artix Linux**, but with a unique approach that blends both flexibility and simplicity.

At the core of NexisOS is a **strictly declarative package management** system that integrates seamlessly with the system configuration, utilizing **TOML** files for managing packages and system settings. This unified approach ensures that users can declare both their package dependencies and configuration changes declaratively, reducing the risk of configuration drift and ensuring reproducible system setups.

Unlike traditional Linux distributions, NexisOS does not rely on central repositories, which helps minimize long-term maintenance costs. Instead, the user defines their own flake sources and configurations, bringing a "captain of your own ship" philosophy to system management.

Security is a foundational priority for NexisOS. The distribution ships with several pre-configured security tools such as **firewalld**, **ClamAV**, **Maldet**, **Falco**, and **Suricata** for endpoint protection, malware detection, runtime security monitoring, and intrusion prevention, helping to create secure and resilient systems right out of the box.

<summary>üöß Project Status</summary>

NexisOS is currently in the **design and planning phase**. Development will begin after core architectural decisions are finalized and trademark and legal preparations are complete.

### In progress:
- Defining the distribution‚Äôs scope, goals, and values
- Applying appropriate licensing to repositories
- Designing the TOML-based configuration system
- Developing security tooling and package infrastructure
- Planning for long-term sustainability and funding

Stay tuned. Star or watch the repo to follow progress as it evolves.

<summary>üîç Design Inspiration</summary>

NexisOS draws from the best parts of:

- **[NixOS](https://nixos.org)** for declarative system configuration, atomic upgrades, and reproducible builds
- **[Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org)** for its minimalist, systemd-free architecture and alternative init systems

Unlike Artix, NexisOS will use **[Dinit](https://github.com/dimitri/dinit)** as its default init system, chosen for its simplicity, modern design, and clean dependency model.

Our goal is to merge these concepts into a focused operating system built on clarity, reproducibility, and user control.

<summary>üôè Acknowledgments</summary>

NexisOS is built upon the contributions of the open-source community. Special thanks to:

- The NixOS community for pioneering declarative system configurations, atomic upgrades, and reproducible builds, which directly inspired NexisOS‚Äôs design.
- The Artix Linux team for their systemd-free, minimalist approach to Linux, which influenced our choice of Dinit as the default init system.
- Dinit for its simplicity, modern design, and clean dependency model, which enables flexible and efficient service management.
- The Rust community for developing the language that powers NexisOS‚Äôs declarative package manager, chosen for its performance and safety.
- The security-focused open-source projects (e.g., firewalld, ClamAV, Maldet, Falco, Suricata) for tools that enhance NexisOS‚Äôs built-in security.
- The broader Linux and open-source communities for their invaluable contributions to the tools and libraries that make projects like NexisOS possible.

NexisOS would not be possible without the foundational work of the open-source ecosystem. The project is deeply grateful for the contributions that have made this work possible, and I, as the founder of NexisOS, personally appreciate the support and inspiration provided by all involved.

As development progresses, we look forward to collaborating with future maintainers and contributors to build on this foundation and create a robust and sustainable operating system for all.
