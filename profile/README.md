## üêß Overview

**NexisOS** is a free and open-source Linux distribution that blends the philosophies and strengths of **NixOS** and **Artix Linux**. It is designed for users who value transparency, control, and reproducibility, offering a fully declarative configuration system and using **Dinit** as its init system.

At the heart of NexisOS is a strictly declarative package manager, inspired by **Nix flakes**, but with a more opinionated and streamlined design. Instead of supporting imperative package installations or multiple configuration styles, NexisOS embraces a single, consistent approach: packages are managed declaratively via **TOML** files. This design prioritizes simplicity, consistency, and reproducibility.

Unlike traditional distributions that maintain central package repositories, which can become maintenance heavy over time, NexisOS encourages a ‚Äú**captain of your own ship**‚Äù philosophy. Users define and manage their own flake sources and configurations, reducing central complexity and promoting sustainability.

Security is a foundational priority for NexisOS. The distribution aims to provide comprehensive Linux security coverage by integrating a suite of endpoint protection tools and monitoring solutions. Currently, NexisOS plans to include and preconfigure security components such as **firewalld** (firewall management), **ClamAV** (antivirus), **Maldet** (Linux malware detector), **Falco** (runtime security and behavioral monitoring), and **Suricata** (intrusion detection and prevention system). These tools work together to provide layered, out-of-the-box protection, helping users deploy secure and resilient systems with ease.

## üöß Project Status

NexisOS is currently in the **design and planning phase**. Development will begin after core architectural decisions are finalized and trademark and legal preparations are complete.

### In progress:
- Defining the distribution‚Äôs scope, goals, and values
- Applying appropriate licensing to repositories
- Designing the TOML-based configuration system
- Developing security tooling and package infrastructure
- Planning for long-term sustainability and funding

Stay tuned. Star or watch the repo to follow progress as it evolves.

## üîç Design Inspiration

NexisOS draws from the best parts of:

- **[NixOS](https://nixos.org)** for declarative system configuration, atomic upgrades, and reproducible builds
- **[Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org)** for its minimalist, systemd-free architecture and alternative init systems

Unlike Artix, NexisOS will use **[Dinit](https://github.com/dimitri/dinit)** as its default init system, chosen for its simplicity, modern design, and clean dependency model.

Our goal is to merge these concepts into a focused operating system built on clarity, reproducibility, and user control.
